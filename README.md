# FSBC_Asst2_ResponsiveWebSite
Assignment 2 of the FSBootcamp is to create a responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap

The website currently has three pages:
- index.html: the main page,
- portfolio.html: contains prior websites that have been created, 
- contacts.html
Buttons have been created for two more (art folio and research papers).  If this was live, I would hide these or make them look disabled until they were complete.

The website uses a bootstrap 4.0 framework.

No additional javascript has been written at this stage, although the bootstrap classes require some javascript, so this has been included.

An additional css page adapts the standard bootstrap presentation and adds some formatting for my additional classes.
Some pseudo classes have been included to add transparancy to background boxes so as to not affect the transparancy of sub-classes.

Not quite happy with the look and feel of this yet, as it's a bit dark.  I'll keep working on that over time.
